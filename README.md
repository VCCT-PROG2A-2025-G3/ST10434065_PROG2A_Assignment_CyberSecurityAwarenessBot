## Overview

The **CyberSecurity Awareness Bot** is a console-based C# application designed to engage users in conversations about cyber safety. It answers common cybersecurity-related questions and shares helpful information in a simple, user-friendly way. This project demonstrates key programming skills such as class structuring, method interaction, file handling, and audio integration.

## Features

- Custom ASCII logo display with colored output
- Sound effects for startup and welcome messages
- Typing animation for chatbot responses
- User-friendly chatbot that handles free-text input
- Topic recognition for:
  - Phishing
  - Password safety
  - Safe browsing
  - General cybersecurity awareness
- Built-in command to exit the chatbot (`exit` or `quit`)

## Project Structure

This application is organized into separate classes to improve maintainability and readability:

- `Program.cs`: The main entry point of the application. Coordinates the flow between logo, audio, and chatbot.
- `LogoClass.cs`: Displays a stylized ASCII logo with alternating colors using `ConsoleColor`.
- `AudioClass.cs`: Plays `.wav` files for startup and welcome sounds.
- `ChatBot.cs`: Core logic of the chatbot, handles user input and generates context-aware responses.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Place the required audio files (`Microsoft Windows XP Startup Sound.wav` and `Welcome Message.wav`) in an `Audio` folder located in the same directory as the executable.
4. Run the program.

## Sample Interaction
You: hey
Chatbot: Hey! What cyber security questions do you have for me?

You: tell me about phishing
Chatbot: Phishing is when attackers try to trick you into giving personal info via fake emails or messages. Always double check URLs and never click suspicious links.

You: how are you
Chatbot: I'm fully patched and running smooth. Thanks for asking!

You: what can I ask you
Chatbot: You can ask me about phishing, password safety, safe browsing or anything cyber related.

You: exit
Chatbot: Stay safe out there. Goodbye!
